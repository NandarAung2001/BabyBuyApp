# BabyBuyApp
Baby Buy is a comprehensive mobile app designed to simplify the process of shopping for baby products. Whether you’re a new parent or shopping for a loved one’s baby shower, Baby Buy is here to help you find the best products at the best prices, all in one place.
=======
This app will let them create a list of things they need to buy before and after their baby is born. The app will also allow users to add descriptions, prices, and pictures for each item. Additionally, it will have features like location tracking to find stores and the ability to delegate tasks to family members.

How Users Will Interact with the App:
Emily, a soon-to-be mom, is getting ready for her baby. She finds an app called BabyBuy on the Play Store and downloads it. After creating an account and logging in, she starts making a list of all the baby items she needs. She can take or upload photos of each item, write descriptions, and add prices. Since her family is helping her, she assigns her mom, Susan, to buy one of the items. The app then sends a text message to Susan with all the details of that item. Emily can also tag where to buy the item so she can find the store easily when shopping. Moreover, she can manage her list by editing, deleting, or marking items as purchased.

Core Features of the App:
Home Screen: A welcoming entry point with a distinct app design.
User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and log in.
Create and Manage Items:
Add items, descriptions, prices, and photos.
Edit, delete, or mark items as purchased.
Item Delegation: Send item details via SMS to someone else.
Optional Features:
Geotagging: Users can tag the location of items and view them on a map.
Gesture Controls: Enhance user experience with gestures like shaking to clear an entry or swiping to mark as purchased or delete items.
The app has no set logo or style, so you have the creative freedom to design its appearance.
